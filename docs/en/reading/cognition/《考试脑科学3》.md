Exam Brain Science 3, written by University of Tokyo professor and neuroscientist Yuji Ikegaya, uses engaging manga to explain how the brain’s motivation switches work and how to overcome short-lived bursts of drive.

## The Three-Minute Motivation Dip

People often find that **whatever feels exciting at first becomes tedious**, and **whatever feels taxing eventually becomes routine**. This phenomenon occurs because our cerebral cortex naturally **habituates**—it decreases its response to repeated stimuli so we can ignore the unimportant and focus on what matters. Habituation is a form of non-associative learning in which our response to a constant stimulus diminishes over time.

By understanding habituation, we can **leverage this built-in adaptation** to turn daunting tasks into habits and sustain our motivation beyond the initial thrill.

## The Motivation “Switches”

Neuroscience identifies four key “switches” that activate the globus pallidus interna—a brain region critical for sustaining drive (motivational “guts”)—and help **transform motivation into lasting effort**.

### 1. Get Your Body Moving

**Physical movement** stimulates the motor cortex, which in turn **activates the motivation center**. Even a fake smile or simply picking up a task tool can **trick the brain** into generating the energy needed to continue.

### 2. Change Your Approach

Introducing **novelty**—like switching your environment or method—engages the hippocampus (memory center) and **re-energizes** the motivation switch. This “newness effect” breaks habituation and restores focus.

### 3. Set Up Rewards

**External rewards** stimulate the ventral tegmental area, releasing dopamine that **activates the motivation circuitry**. To prevent rapid habituation to rewards, the book suggests **linking pleasurable habits to task completion** (e.g., only allowing yourself a treat after hitting a study milestone).

### 4. Immerse Yourself

Through **misattribution**—the brain’s tendency to misassign arousal causes—**“bridge effect”** or similar high-arousal contexts can **falsely boost motivation**. Visualizing the excitement of completion or creating a stimulating atmosphere can fool the brain into sustaining effort.

## Turning Effort into Habit

When one of these switches stays active over repeated sessions, it **reinforces striatal circuits**, forming a **habit loop** that makes challenging tasks effortless over time. The manga format illustrates **16 practical techniques** across these four switches, making complex neuroscience **easy and fun** for students, parents, and teachers alike.

Finally, a quote from the book to close today’s reading:

<HSentence>
"It’s not that motivation comes before action;<br>
it’s by raising your fist first that motivation follows.  <br>
You have to actively welcome 'guts.'"
