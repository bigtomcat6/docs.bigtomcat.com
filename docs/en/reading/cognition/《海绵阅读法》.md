> Reading is a high-compound-interest activity.

<!-- more -->

**People who read regularly and those who don’t develop widening cognitive gaps over time.** _And among readers, those who truly engage with the text learn far more than those who merely consume words._

**So how can we absorb a book’s essence efficiently?**

## The Purpose of Reading

> What is the purpose of reading?

**_Why do people fail? Why do they suffer?_**  
At root, it’s because their perception of the world strays from reality. The larger this gap, the higher the cost of living in illusion.  
_For example, Emma Bovary’s romantic illusions clashed with tedious reality—ending in tragedy._

Some create brilliant products but find no buyers—because what they value most holds little value for others.

**How can we bridge that gap to reality?**  
1. **Interact with reality: practice, fail, and refine.**  
2. **Learn from others’ experience—reading is the fastest, most economical way.**

The world is huge, yet we each inhabit a smaller sphere of our own.  
<u>**Our life’s mission is to solve the problems that arise within our personal world.**</u>

Every book addresses one or more of those problems—our motivations and interests stem from these needs.

## The Five-Step Reading Process

> Now that we know why we read, how do we read?

Based on the author’s guidance, here are five steps:

### 1. Clarify Motivation

Decide if the book warrants your limited attention.

### 2. Survey the Framework

Skim the preface, contents, or summary to grasp key questions and solutions—this tells you whether to skim or deep-read.

### 3. Outline the Structure

Read through, then map the chapters and main points.

_Example outline:_
```markmap
# Sponge Reading Method

## Effective Note-Taking
- Two roles of notes:
  - Aid immediate comprehension
  - Facilitate future memory
- Three levels of notes:
  1. Fragmented annotations
  2. Global mind maps
  3. Structural internalization

## Independent Thinking
- Generating ideas
- Evaluating ideas
- Organizing ideas

## Reading Speed
- Visual vs. auditory processing
- Skimming vs. deep reading

## Genre-Specific Approaches
- Mainstream reading
- Gourmet reading
- Snack reading
- Fruit reading

## Knowledge System Creation
- System features
- Why build one?
- How to build one

## Applying Reading
- Deep understanding
- Five guiding principles

## Habit Sustainability
- Habit formation strategies
```

## 4. Reconstruct the Framework

Review your outline. If unclear, reread and refine, turning the book’s structure into your own.

_Reconstructed example:_
```markmap
# Sponge Reading Method Reconstructed

## Why Read?
- Entertainment
- Problem-solving

## Techniques
- Speed vs. depth
- Note-taking models

## Application
- Independent thinking drills
- Knowledge system loops

## Monetization
- Article writing
- Digital products

## Habit Formation
```

This step forges a personal connection to the author’s ideas.

### 5. Deliberate Practice

Apply ideas to real situations. **Actions cement insights more than passive review.**

Putting It Into Action

> How do we make lasting change rather than revert to old habits?

The author says:

<HSentence>
Old self + Book insights = New self
</HSentence>

**But if unanchored, the “new self” slips back.** Short-term memory fades—about 70% lost in one day, 80% in a month.

The solution? **Interconnect insights into a cohesive knowledge network.**

::: note
For instance, to remember “133589101031,” instead of rote repetition, spot a pattern (e.g., today’s date) so a single anchor lets you reconstruct the rest.
:::

Likewise, weave individual learnings into a retrieval-friendly map.

Intentional note-taking is key—detailed methods to follow in the next session.
