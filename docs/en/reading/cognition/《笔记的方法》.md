> Why is it that even when we understand many truths, we still struggle to live a fulfilling life?

Sometimes, the gap between knowing and doing is bridged by one crucial element. That bridge is note-taking. This book may just revolutionize the way we think about our notes.

## The Meaning of Note-Taking

> Why take notes?

Every so often, brilliant ideas strike—whether while showering, eating, or walking. These flashes of inspiration are fleeting; if not captured, they vanish, along with the opportunities they might have unlocked in the future. **Often, the answers to the puzzles we wrestle with come suddenly—but if we don’t jot them down in the midst of our exhilaration, the inspiration quickly fades away.**

**Yet, those forgotten ideas could one day provide tremendous assistance.** So, what exactly is note-taking?

<u>**Note-taking is the process of creating an external brain—a temporary repository where we store valuable information for future retrieval.**</u>

The book states:

<HSentence center>Note-taking is the pre-processing of valuable information to reinforce your future self.</HSentence>

_**In essence, note-taking is like leaving yourself little sticky notes for the future. Once they’re handed over to tomorrow, they become the magic that strengthens you.**_

_But how should these little notes be written?_

## The Method of Note-Taking

> How should we take notes?

There’s a concept called "necessary difficulty." The idea is that **knowledge that comes too easily is quickly forgotten and rarely applied.** Therefore, effective note-taking must involve just the right amount of resistance—enough to leave a lasting imprint in the brain without being so complex that it becomes unsustainable.

Simple, effortless record-keeping is futile, yet overly elaborate systems are hard to maintain. With this in mind, let’s address three common misconceptions:

### 1. Saving/Favoriting ≠ Note-Taking

> "Saving" simply means storing content without any reflection or transformation.

Merely bookmarking articles or videos rarely leads to later review; it often becomes a form of self-soothing rather than genuine learning.

### 2. Highlighting ≠ Note-Taking

> "Highlighting" involves marking up someone else’s words without processing them in your own language.

While colorful annotations and copious quotes might look impressive, they rarely have a lasting impact if you don’t rephrase and internalize the ideas.

### 3. Ornate Journals ≠ Note-Taking

> Focusing too much on beautifying your journal can overshadow the essential steps of thinking and internalization.

Artistic, elaborate notebooks may be visually pleasing, but their purpose is merely aesthetic appreciation—they often fail to translate into practical benefits in your life.

**_So what is the right approach?_** Simply put: <u>express the useful knowledge in your own words.</u>

For a concept to truly become your own, it must pass through a process of personal reflection. When you distill an idea into your own succinct language, it forges the first mental connection. Always record those valuable insights as they arise, and add tags to each note.

_Why include tags?_

Tags not only make retrieval easier, but they also serve as a medium for innovation. In learning, we store new information in our brains; innovation happens when that stored knowledge forms new connections. For example, merging the internet with physical retail gave rise to e-commerce, or combining computers with telephones led to smartphones. **To spark innovation, we need to link various pieces of knowledge—and tags are the bridge that makes those connections.**

The book’s author also shares detailed insights on using software and models for tagging, but we won’t dive into those details here.

Once you grasp the method, another crucial question arises: What should you record?

## What to Record?

The advent of the internet means we can easily access an overwhelming amount of information, which can lead to “information addiction.”

_Think about it: you might stumble upon a fascinating space article, a novel perspective on psychology, or even investment advice you don’t yet need—but your mind ends up cluttered with fragmented information. <u>The end result? We may know a little about everything, yet fail to have any practical application.</u>_

In today’s age of information overload, filtering and organizing data is more critical than ever.

**_Be wary of these three types of content:_**

1. Content that stokes panic and incites strong emotions  
   _e.g., "Shocking! These jobs will be replaced by AI in the near future."_
2. Content that excessively pampers your emotions, making you too comfortable  
   _e.g., "Embracing apathy is a revolutionary lifestyle."_
3. Extremely subjective opinions with no factual backing  
   _e.g., viewpoints that sound thrilling like escapist fiction but fall apart under scrutiny._

::: note The above content isn’t necessarily worthless; however, absorb such knowledge cautiously and with critical thought.
:::

**_Here are three types of information I record daily:_**

1. Sudden bursts of inspiration  
2. Insights gained from reading  
3. Beautiful moments in life

**When you capture those flashes of brilliance and moments of joy, you create a bond with your future self.** It’s like saying, _“Hey, I’ve got another great idea for you.”_

Moreover, over time, you can record your personal experiences and practical implementations. This way, your notes not only serve as a repository but also clearly demonstrate the changes in your life.
