The author argues that while many factors contribute to success, it ultimately comes down to the difference in our mindsets.

## Two Types of Mindsets

According to the author, **the way people view their own abilities gives rise to two distinct mindsets.**

- One group believes that their abilities are fixed and unchangeable—this is the ***"Fixed Mindset"***.
- The other group sees abilities as malleable, capable of growth with effort—this is the ***"Growth Mindset"***.

It sounds simple, yet this difference underpins many complex phenomena.

People with a fixed mindset tend to believe, "This is who I am; I can't change," so when faced with a challenge, they quickly throw in the towel. In contrast, those with a growth mindset view difficulties as opportunities for improvement, seeing the process of overcoming obstacles as a path to self-development.

Fixed mindset individuals often feel the need to constantly prove themselves—reminiscing about past glories, dwelling on old successes, and even chasing after luxury items to reaffirm their self-worth. In contrast, people with a growth mindset actively seek out information that will elevate their understanding because they believe that both they and those around them are continually evolving. Their attitude toward challenges is not only different; it also affects their interpersonal interactions, making them more patient and open to communication.

**Typically, fixed mindset people come off as either arrogant or insecure—they fear criticism while being quick to criticize others; whereas those with a growth mindset tend to appear calm, humble, and kind.**

_Then, how do these two mindsets form?_

## The Origins of Our Mindsets

Imagine three children building a block tower together—no matter how hard they try, they just can’t get it right. Their father chooses to educate them in three different ways:

- The first child’s father simply demonstrates the correct way by saying, “Look, see how easily it can be done. It’s so simple, isn’t it?”
- The second child’s father continuously offers praise, saying, “Let’s try again—you’re so smart, you can definitely do it.”
- The third child’s father, however, says, “We haven’t succeeded yet because we might be using the wrong method.”

Which child is more likely to develop a growth mindset?

> *This case is meant to illustrate how different approaches can shape our thinking—it’s not absolute.*

- The first child, comparing his struggles with others’ ease, may conclude that he’s simply not smart enough. Repeated failures and self-doubt can lead him to believe that change is impossible, solidifying a fixed mindset.
- The second child, constantly bolstered by praise, might become confident—but he may also attribute all successes solely to his innate talent, which again reinforces a fixed mindset.
- The third child learns that failure is not a reflection of his inherent ability but rather a sign that he needs to refine his methods. This perspective fosters a growth mindset.

Thus, whether through unconstructive criticism or empty praise, both approaches can inadvertently encourage a fixed mindset. Only by objectively recognizing that success lies in the process—and by finding the right methods—can one cultivate a truly healthy, growth-oriented outlook.

## Applications in Everyday Life

These two mindsets manifest in every aspect of life. Consider, for example, making short videos. Some people, upon seeing impressive clips, immediately think, “They’re amazing—learning this will take forever,” while those with a growth mindset begin by objectively analyzing what skills are required and then experiment to determine exactly how much time and effort are needed.

Because our mindset shapes our attitude and approach to challenges, it often directly affects outcomes. Moreover, these mindsets influence our relationships. In intimate partnerships, if both people believe they can grow together, they are more inclined to communicate openly, resolving conflicts and gradually deepening their connection. Likewise, organizations with a growth mindset are better equipped to bounce back in challenging environments.

It’s important to note that every person actually harbors a blend of both mindsets—varying by context and over time. However, once we start judging someone solely through the lens of one mindset, we risk falling into the trap of a fixed perspective ourselves.
