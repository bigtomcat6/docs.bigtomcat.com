> How can we cultivate a more resilient sense of self?

<!-- more -->

Life’s setbacks—shattered relationships, departing partners, ended friendships—affect us all. Some people recover swiftly, while others remain mired in pain.

In *Emerging from the Dark Forest*, psychologist Hai-xian Chen explains:
<HSentence>
Psychological pain arises when the old self refuses to depart as the new self is born.
</HSentence>

When both selves coexist in conflict, the inner struggle drains our vitality and darkens our mood. Yet each person’s response to that struggle differs.

## Facing Broken Relationships

A broken relationship marks the end of one story and the start of another. Loss need not be solely tragic.

<HSentence left>
Good losses:<br>
Memories of the relationship’s beauty nourish your new self;<br>
Its pain provides lessons for self-creation.

Bad losses:<br>
Clinging to the past traps you in nostalgia;<br>
Fear of past hurts prevents you from beginning anew.
</HSentence>

If we shift our hope toward a stronger new self, the old story becomes fuel for growth. If we cling to the past, the old self obstructs renewal.

## The Five Stages of Self-Transformation

Chen Hai-xian outlines **five stages** in forging a new self:

### Stage One: Answering the Call  
Discover who you truly wish to become and identify a “container”—a relationship, experience, or space—that can hold your transformation.

### Stage Two: Letting Go of the Old Self  
As the old self inflicts more pain, you must mourn and ultimately bid it farewell, moving from loss to liberation.

### Stage Three: Embarking on a New Journey  
With space cleared, new relationships—partners, friends, or work—enter. You experiment and begin to shape a new identity.

### Stage Four: Embracing the New Self  
You shift from seeking others’ validation to trusting your own judgment. Independent and confident, you settle into your renewed self.

### Stage Five: Writing a New Story  
Your past becomes the bedrock of a richer narrative. Though even new stories age, you now face them with equanimity.
